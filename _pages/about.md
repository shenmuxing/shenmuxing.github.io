I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the **School of Artificial Intelligence (SAI)**, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)**, supervised by [Prof. Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io/).

Previously, I obtained my Master's degree from the **Antai College of Economics and Management**, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, where I was advised by [Prof. Kai Wang](https://cs-kaiwang.github.io/). Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies at **Xi'an Jiaotong University**, under the supervision of [Prof. Haishan Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kriqtukAAAAJ).

My research interests primarily lie in the **theory and applications of Reinforcement Learning**.
